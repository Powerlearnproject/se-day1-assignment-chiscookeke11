Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer: Software engineering is the application of engineering techniques in developing and maintaining high quality software systems.
Software engineering is the key to technological advancement, it enables the creation of systems that improve various aspect of human life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer: 1. Development of programming languages, e.g Fortran, C.
2. establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline.
3. The rise of Agile methodologies in 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirement: this involves gathering information and user requirements.
2. design: this involves creating a design
3. implementation:  this involves implementing the design
4. testing: this entails testing the software
5. deployment: software is deployed if it passes the test.
6. maintenance: this is regular update of the software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is sequential and follows a path while the Agile methodology is flexible and responsive to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Softwarer developer: writes the code
quality assurance engineer: ensures that the software meets the expected requirements by regular testing and checking of features.
Project manager: oversees the entire process of software engineering.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs aid in effective and proper code writing, an example is sublime text.
A VCS help in managing code changes and collaboration.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Change in requirements. It can be addressed by proper communication.
2. Tight deadlines. It can be overcome by adapting agile methodologies and prioritization of task.
3. Technical debt. It can be overcome by proper assessment of project.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing involves testing a particular component in a software.
2. Integration testing involves testing the interactions between components in a software.
3. System testing involves testing the systems on which the software will be executed.
4. Acceptance testing involves testing the features to ensure that the software meets the requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves the use of specific and concise sentences to get a proper result from an AI. Prompt Engineering makes interaction with AI better.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Here is an example of a vague prompt: Write about the history of the Romans. 
This is how the prompt can be improved: Write about the educational history of the Romans.
